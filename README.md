Chronos Maven Plugins and Samples
=================================

I've been attempting to find out what these maven plugins actually do,
as I'm not sure that they even work. I've been lopoking for an SCM repo
where the source code could be found as well, and I have always come up short.

This evening I made an unexpected discovery. I saw that at Maven Central
there was a source-release.zip file.

I have downloaded it, created a github repo, made a small massaging pass
through the code and have commited the code to github. So, finally some progress.
