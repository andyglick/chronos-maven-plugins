Ramp-up test.

   A ramp-up test is performed to validate the optimum and maximum performance of Your system.

   It is performed by gradually increasing the load while monitoring responsetimes and spikes in these,
   until a stagnation of performance is reached.

   In this type of test the individual requests are not relevant, we are more interested in the large picture. How does the
   observed responsetimes and throughput change over time.

   Histograms should also be disabled, since not very much can be concluded, when the test contains heterogenous requests
   (heterogenous over time).

   The resulting report will contain responsetime statistics (in table and graphic form), throughput and possibly garbage collection info.
